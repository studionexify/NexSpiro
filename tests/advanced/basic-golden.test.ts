// RE-PINNED (reverse-verifier remediation): Basic hashes changed only because a first-layer bottom-surface width of 0 now means
// 'same as initial layer' as its tooltip says (checked: reverting that one line restores the old hashes). Advanced hashes changed because
// E now follows true 3-D bead length / local bead height on non-planar paths (see tests/reverse-verifier).
// Basic mode must keep producing exactly the G-code of the classic engine. These hashes were taken from
// the engine before the Advanced core existed; if a deliberate Basic-engine change alters them, update
// them in the same commit and say why.
// Updated with the Basic settings rework (PR #22), which changed the classic engine's defaults and
// toolpath rules (walls, seams, cooling, travel). The new hashes were checked to be identical before and after
// merging the Advanced core, so the Advanced plumbing itself still leaves Basic mode untouched. The P1S hash
// changed once more only because the G-code config block now reads gcode_flavor = bbl (flavour renamed).
// All four changed again only because the config block lists the new outline_smoothing / outline_smoothing_corner
// settings (off by default); with those two lines removed the G-code hashes are exactly the previous ones.
// The two cylinder hashes changed with the slicing speed-up: cross-section outlines now drop the points that lie
// on a straight wall (the crossings of a flat face's diagonal edge, which slid from layer to layer) and the ones
// within the path resolution, so identical layers are recognised and their polygon work is reused. Wall points
// move by less than the Resolution setting (0.012 mm); the cube and the supported tee are unchanged.
// All four changed again only because the config block lists the new multi-material printer settings (changer_type,
// toolhead_count, tool_prime_volume, standby_temperature_delta, tool_preheat_time); with those five lines removed the
// G-code hashes are exactly the previous ones.
// Arc fitting is now on by default; the cases that predate that pin it off so their G-code (and hashes) stay as they were.
// All four changed again only because the config block lists the new filament-unit printer settings (purge_target,
// filament_slots); with those two lines removed the G-code hashes are exactly the previous ones.
// All four changed again only because the config block lists the new tool-changer printer settings
// (tool_off_after_last_use, tool_map); with those two lines removed the G-code hashes are exactly the previous ones.
// All four changed again only because the config block lists the new colour-mixing and ooze-prevention settings
// (mix_subdivide, mix_subdivide_full_domain, mix_subdivide_infill, ooze_prevention, preheat_delta_temperature);
// with those five lines removed the G-code hashes are exactly the previous ones.
// And again for mmu_segmented_region_max_width, mmu_segmented_region_interlocking_depth and default_wipe_tower_pos
// (config block only; with those lines removed the G-code is byte-identical to the original hashes above).
// The P1S hash changed on purpose: the P1S now runs Bambu Studio's own start / end / change / layer G-code and Bambu's
// machine values (retract_before_wipe 0 %, Z hop limit 249 mm, 250 mm print height); the other three are unchanged.
// Re-pinned once more for the end-of-print marker comment before Bambu's end G-code (the only line that differs).
