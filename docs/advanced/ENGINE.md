# NexSpiro Advanced engine (Physics Core)

The header's centre toggle switches the slicing engine:

- **BASIC (Bambu Engine)** — the classic heuristic slicer, unchanged. `tests/advanced/basic-golden.test.ts` pins its G-code byte for byte.
- **ADVANCED (NexSpiro Physics Core)** — every part is analysed, split into zones, and compiled with the subset of the 35 technologies that the selected **intent** and **machine** call for.

```

| Stage | Where | Hook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fields & zones | `analysis.ts`, `sdf.ts`, `meshfields.ts`, `sections.ts` | `analyzePart()` |
| Layer plan | curved layers are a Z warp `z = z′ + dz(x, y, z′)`; meshes are warped, sliced flat, and every move is un-warped | `TechModule.warp` |
| Regions | cross-section edits before walls | `TechModule.reshape` |
| Walls / infill | replace the classic generator for one island or sparse region | `TechModule.walls`, `TechModule.infill` |
| Toolpath passes | edit the ordered move list (`LayerOps`) before plugins | `TechModule.post` |
| Rheology & motion | speeds, flow, fan and temperature on the final move list | `TechModule.finalize` |

Modules are listed in pipeline order in `src/engine/advanced/modules/index.ts`. A technology runs only when it is enabled (intent default or user override) **and** the machine model allows it.

## Machine capability model

`machine.ts` derives, for every printer profile: kinematics, axis count, firmware features (input shaping, pressure advance, arcs), Z limits, hotend flow, chamber, material changer, frame resonance, and the **head clearance** — the steepest slope a non-planar move can follow before the heater block or fan duct reaches printed plastic:

`θ_max = min over head volumes of atan((lift − margin) / reach)`, with `reach` the farthest point of the volume's footprint from the nozzle (the worst slope direction). Stock Bambu heads give ≈ 11°, a Revo/Stealthburner ≈ 15–20°, a 5-axis machine is not limited by it.

Every technology has a `mould()` rule returning *ok*, *adapted* (runs in a reduced or machine-specific form, with the reason) or *unavailable* (with the reason). Users can edit the capability model (tip length, resonance, flow, chamber, kinematics up to 5-axis) for modified or future machines.

## Zones

| Zone | Found by |
| --- | --- |
| Domes / shallow slopes | up-facing triangles, slope 1–35°, mean curvature |
| Curved walls | slope 35–80° |
| Overhangs | down-facing beyond the support angle |
| High-stress necks | cross-section area minima (< 60 % of both neighbours) |
| Bosses / holes | round holes (circularity > 0.85, r 0.8–12 mm) on ≥ 3 planes |
| Helical zones | steady single-island Z bands (area change < 5 %) |
| Cores | voxels deeper than the shell plus two lines |
| Thin walls / interfaces | wall thickness along the inward normal; paint-colour boundaries |

## Verification

- `tests/advanced/phase1.test.ts`: SDF against analytic distances, curvature (Gauss–Bonnet), thickness, topology (genus), zone detection, slicing in every intent on Bambu, Klipper and Marlin machines.
- `tests/advanced/basic-golden.test.ts`: Basic-mode G-code hashes.

## Phase 2 — field, PDE & geometric solvers

| Piece | File | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linear solvers | `solvers.ts` | Jacobi-PCG (3D Laplace with Dirichlet/Neumann cells), multigrid-preconditioned CG for 2D (screened) Poisson, sparse Jacobi-PCG for thin bands |
| Harmonic dome field (#24) | `harmonic.ts` | ∇²φ = 0, φ = 0 on bed cells, φ = 1 on cells under dome/shallow triangles, zero flux elsewhere. Per column, warped height z′ = H·φ(z) is inverted to a displacement d(x, y, z′); a per-column conformity λ keeps every layer under 75 % of the clearance slope, then a global scale enforces slope ≤ 80 % of θ_max and layer ratio within [min, max] |
| Curved layers | `warp.ts` | Meshes are warped z → z′ (bisection on the monotone map), sliced flat, and every move is mapped back with adaptive splitting where the layer bends more than 0.01 mm from the chord; extrusion × ∂z/∂z′. The first 0.45 mm stays flat and the warp fades in over 1.2 mm |
| SGD slicing (#14) | `sgd.ts` | Tensor-product cubic B-spline d(x, y, z′); L = w₁ overhang (angle to the tilted layer under the support threshold) + w₂ clearance (slope over the limit) + w₃ anisotropy (layer ∥ up-facing skin) + w₄ thickness error; exact gradients, Adam, mini-batches. Refines the dome warp when both are on |
| Heat-method walls (#15) | `offsets.ts` | Raster the island; Eikonal distance by fast sweeping (exact distances at the boundary); in a band up to the deepest wall: (I − tΔ)u = 0, X = −∇u/|∇u|, Δφ = ∇·X, anchored to the Eikonal distance on the band's inner edge; marching-squares isolines, cubic B-spline smoothing (C²). Outer wall stays an exact offset; repeated outlines reuse their solution |
| Conformal skins (#4) | `surface.ts` | Top-skin points move to the CAD surface height within ±½ layer (ray cast up), flow for the new bead height |
| Clearance checker (Task 2.3) | `clearance.ts` | Height maps of finished layers and of the current layer (3 mm lag); a non-planar point must keep the nozzle cone, heater block, fan duct and carriage above printed plastic and its tip ≥ 0.03 mm above the finished layer under it. Lifts up to ½ layer, otherwise reports |

Verification: `tests/advanced/phase2.test.ts` — PCG, Laplace linear solution, multigrid Poisson against the analytic square value, heat and Eikonal distance against the exact disk distance, isoline areas, dome-warp limits and inverse map, un-warp flow scaling, SGD loss decrease on a T, clearance lift/report, curved-layer slices with zero unresolved collisions.

## Phase 3 — continuous helices, seam elimination & surface compilers

| Technology | File | What the toolpath does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #21 Thick-vase helix | `modules/thickVase.ts` | In helical bands (steady single-island stretches), each layer is rebuilt in a canonical loop order (outer walls by size, inner walls, infill) so every point sits at the same fraction of the turn each layer; z = layer surface − h·(1 − s/S), relative to the move's own z (curved layers stay curved); hops inside the part lose their retraction; infill becomes a connected spiral |
| #3 Eulerian spiral | `eulerian.ts` | Concentric rings joined level by level into unbroken spirals (each ring stops one spacing short and steps in); the innermost ring widens (0.75–2.5 × nozzle) instead of gap fill |
| #22 Tangential entry | `modules/seams.ts` | One-turn Archimedean spiral just inside the walls, an approach that merges into the wall at ≤ 3° (smoothstep inset over 1.5·D/tan α), the loop, and a mirrored lead-out; skipped when the spiral would leave the part (SDF check) |
| #23 Scarf splice | `modules/seams.ts` | Wedge start half a layer low with E(s) = 3(s/L)² − 2(s/L)³, the loop, then the complementary wedge at full height at 60 % speed with the part fan off for 150 ms |
| #8 Sub-voxel anti-aliasing | `modules/surfacePasses.ts` | Outer beads under shallow slopes are lowered onto the CAD surface inside their layer band (never raised: the flat of the tip spans the neighbour) |
| #26 Perimeter feathering | `modules/surfacePasses.ts` | On rounded sides leaning in (30–80°), the outer bead drops by up to ½ layer and shifts outward along the surface normal (shingled) |
| #25 Conformal ironing | `modules/surfacePasses.ts` | Up-facing surfaces within the head's slope limit, seen from above, are burnished by concentric isoline passes at the CAD height (1.5 % flow); points the head cannot reach are skipped |
| #7 Z-weave & Z-pins | `modules/weave.ts` | Inner walls and infill follow an egg-crate offset A·h·sin kx·sin ky with alternating sign per layer; flow follows the real bead height against an offset map of what is below; speed capped by the Z axis (v ≤ v_z/(A·h·k·√2), v ≤ √(a_z/(2A·h·k²))). Pins: voids of r = 1.2 mm through N layers in deep cores, filled by a vertical extrusion; the dive depth comes from the nozzle cone and tip length |
| #19 Knot braiding | `modules/weave.ts` | Walls 1 and 2 become two strands M ∓ n·(s/2)·cos ωs that swap sides at each crossing; the strand printed second lifts over the crossing (per-point Z offsets); strands swap slots every layer so over and under alternate |

The slicer gained two generic hooks for this phase: per-point Z offsets on wall loops (`zs`, kept through seam rotation) and a walls post-edit hook.

Verification: `tests/advanced/phase3.test.ts`. A fully combined Seamless Aesthetic compile on Bambu, Klipper and Marlin machines leaves at most 0.1 % of non-planar points reported (worst < 0.25 mm), all of them listed in the warnings.

## Phase 4 — field solvers, metamaterials & lattices

New slicer hooks: a **zone router** for sparse infill (each technology claims the part of a region it is made for and passes on the rest; whatever is left gets the regular pattern), a **material-region hook** (dovetails), the layer plan for **reshape** (cross-section edits know their z), per-point **wall widths** (kept through seam rotation), and a `noClear` flag for free-space draws whose clearance holds by construction.

| Piece | File | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Voxel FEA | `fea.ts` | 8-node trilinear hexahedra (2×2×2 Gauss), matrix-free Jacobi-PCG, eigenstrain loads, element stresses, cyclic-Jacobi principal stresses, nodal averaging + trilinear sampling. Cantilever tip deflection within 2 % of beam theory |
| Load case | `stress.ts` | Painted fixture (1) / load (2) faces, sampled at half-element spacing onto surface nodes; otherwise bed contact + all but one bolt hole fixed, load at the farthest bolt hole (or the top face); direction and force from the Load card |
| #1 Stress-aligned paths | `modules/fea.ts`, `streamlines.ts` | Where von Mises exceeds the chosen percentile, in-plane principal directions (σ₁ tension or σ₃ compression, or both alternating) as ψ = w·e^{2iθ}; evenly spaced RK4 streamlines (Jobard–Lefer) with sign alignment of the line field. Also the inspector's `stress` field |
| #33 Spinor fields | `stress.ts`, `streamlines.ts` | Principal frames → unit quaternions; averaging blind to ±q and to axis flips (q·{1, i, j, k}) via the dominant eigenvector of Σ w q qᵀ; directions back through the Hopf map q e q̄. Per layer, ±½ defects (winding of arg ψ) are moved to the nearest point outside the material by ψ ← ψ·((w − b)/(w − p))^s |
| #28 Quasicrystal | `modules/quasicrystal.ts` | Six five-fold axes of ℤ⁶ → ℝ³; plane families (de Bruijn multigrid dual of the cut-and-project) spaced as Fibonacci chains x_n = n + ⌊n/τ + α⌋/τ; families tilted beyond the limit dropped; orientation search (240 up-vectors): most families, then in-plane isotropy. Five-fold up → 5 families at 26.6°, isotropic. Claims the core zone |
| #9 Gray–Scott | `modules/turing.ts` | Anisotropic D = D₀(I + β d⊗d) along stress (or the outline tangent), halved round bolt holes; 2000 burn-in steps, 50 per layer (Z continuation); ribs are v = 0.2 contours; cell size from the infill density |
| #35 Homogenization | `homogenize.ts`, `modules/cells.ts` | Periodic voxel cell, six unit macro-strain cases, C^H_ij = (1/|Y|) Σ (χ⁰ − χ)ᵀK(χ⁰ − χ). Solid cell recovers C exactly. Gyroid density from a power-law fit through two homogenized cells; negative ν by bisection on the homogenized re-entrant cell (target −0.5 → 69°, ν = −0.51) |
| #12 Metamaterial | `modules/cells.ts` | Re-entrant honeycomb rows (shared column positions, golden-ratio dithered strut lengths: aperiodic, connected); strut width graded by compliance (low stress or depth → thinner) |
| #34 Band gap | `bloch.ts`, `modules/bandGap.ts` | Honeycomb frame + disc resonator per cell on three spiral ligaments; f_r = √(3Ew³/(m_r L³))/2π placed at target/(1 + m_r/m_f)^{1/4}; Bloch dynamical matrix (Hermitian Jacobi via the real embedding), band edges over the BZ, Chern number by Fukui–Hatsugai (0 for this passive lattice), valley Chern with A/B pads (≈ −0.39 at 10 % contrast, → ±½ as the gap closes). 800 Hz → 5 mm cells, gap 620–1032 Hz |
| #18 Foam control | `modules/foam.ts` | X(T) = 1 + (X_max − 1)·smoothstep((T − 205)/45); hubs cool, cores hot; M104 issued τ·ln(ΔT/2) s ahead; runs shorter than τ/2 keep the setting; first-order observer predicts nozzle T and every extrusion is divided by X(T). Adds the Generic LW-PLA preset |
| #16 Inverse warp | `modules/inverseWarp.ts` | Inherent strain ε* = −s(1, 1, 0.3) per filament (PLA 0.3 % … PP 1.5 %, ×0.6 in a heated chamber); four height bands activated in turn on the bed, then the bed reaction released on a 3-2-1 support; toolpath x′ = x − g·u(x); 0.6 mm kerfs every 20 mm across sections ≥ 2.5 mm deep; warns of curl the layer plane cannot pre-bend |
| #11 Spatial lattice | `modules/lattice.ts` | Opt-in: above 3 base layers, octahedral truss (posts with dwell, diagonals, struts at each level), cell height ≤ tip length − 0.4 mm, pitch ≥ tip length, full fan |
| #13 Dovetail | `modules/dovetail.ts` | Checkerboard fingers (pitch/2) in a band of `depth` on both sides of each material boundary, phase flipped per layer; area conserving. Needs AMS / tool changer |
| #20 Co-molding | `modules/coMolding.ts` | Opt-in: cavity = depth > shell (closes in 3D), perforated tube columns, a sprue tube to the cavity bottom, a vent at its highest point |
| #29 Metric morph | `modules/metricMorph.ts` | g = I + ∇f⊗∇f of the top height field; bead angle α solving ρ(α) = 1/√(1 + \|∇f\|²) with λ⊥ = λ^{-1/2}; flat sheet = footprint outline + evenly spaced director streamlines, fast beads |
| #30 Monge–Ampère | `modules/mongeAmpere.ts` | Log-domain Sinkhorn with ε-scaling (separable log-sum-exp), barycentric map, ∇h = (T − x)/((n − 1)·throw), Poisson-integrated; lens mode carves the top, lampshade mode sets outer-wall widths by Beer–Lambert |

Verification: `tests/advanced/fea.test.ts`, `homogenize.test.ts`, `bloch.test.ts`, `phase4.test.ts` (cantilever streamlines align with bending tension, Fibonacci gaps, rib continuity between layers, band gap holds the target, auxetic ν, foam schedule, ABS warp compensation and kerfs, truss, dovetail area/phase, co-mold material saving, flat sheet, lens and lampshade). Structural Armor on a 60×30×12 mm part slices in about 8 s (Basic: 0.06 s).

## Phase 5 — rheology, kinematics & the topological router

| Technology | File | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Motion planner | `planner.ts` | Trapezoidal look-ahead with junction deviation v_j² = a·δ·sin(θ/2)/(1 − sin(θ/2)), δ = scv²(√2 − 1)/a; backward (stoppable) and forward (reachable) passes, per-move entry/cruise/exit speeds and times |
| #6 Kinematic extrusion | `modules/motion.ts` | Corners where the planner slows are reported; without firmware PA, software pressure advance ΔE = K·Δv·E/len on each speed change; with PA: planning only |
| #31 Symplectic shaper | `modules/motion.ts` | Frame as a damped oscillator (resonance from the machine model) integrated with Störmer–Verlet; accelerations retimed so each ramp lasts a whole number of periods (residual ringing ≈ 0). With firmware input shaping only ramps still ringing over 4× the tolerance are retimed (no double shaping) |
| #10 Corner overshoot | `modules/motion.ts` | At outer-wall corners sharper than the threshold the nozzle swings d = g·w/2·(1 − sin(φ/2)) past the corner at 60 % flow and returns dry; halved with firmware PA |
| #27 Iso-gloss | `modules/rheology.ts` | Outer wall at one speed on every layer (exempt from the cooling slowdown); short layers take their time from the other features, the rest from the fan: fan′ = fan·(t_min/t)^γ. Reports τ_w |
| #17 Gloss modulation | `modules/rheology.ts` | Painted matte/gloss faces (values 3/4) set the outer-wall speed: τ_w = K((3n+1)/4n · 4Q/πR³)ⁿ (PLA K = 4500 Pa·sⁿ, n = 0.35), high shear for matte, low for gloss |
| #5 Hot-on-hot | `modules/rheology.ts` | Lumped bead cooling ρch·dT/dt = −h(T − T_amb), h = 15 + 85·fan W/m²K, over the planned layer time; the fan is cut (up to the limit) until the layer below is still above Tg + margin when the next one lands; layers that cannot reach it are reported |
| #32 Morse–Smale router | `modules/morse.ts` | Reeb graph from the cross-section islands (overlap links), births/deaths/merges/splits, elder-rule persistence and simplification below the threshold; branches routed to planar, helix, curved layers, support or reorientation (5-axis); the inspector's `branch` field |

Verification: `tests/advanced/phase5.test.ts` — junction speed at a right angle, period-timed ramps cut ringing by > 70 %, no double shaping on Bambu, software PA on Marlin, overshoot corners, power-law shear scaling, one outer-wall speed across layers, matte vs gloss shear, fan cuts for the layer bond, the branches of an arch, a mid-air branch routed to support, and every intent compiled on Bambu X1C/A1/H2D, Voron (Klipper), Prusa MK4S and Ender-3 V2 (Marlin) with every technology present and < 1 % unresolved clearance points.
